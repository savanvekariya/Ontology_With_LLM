As a knowledge graph expert, your task is to extract all possible meaningful triplets from a given sentence following a specific schema. 
The schema defines triplets in the format { head : ENTITY 1, realation : RELATIONSHIP, tail : ENTITY 2 } .
Keeping in mind that ENTITY should not be more than three words and should not include articles such as 'a', 'an', or 'the'. ENTITY should not contain verb.
ENTITY has to be subclass of ["benefits","development stage","disruption","embodiment","improvement","innovation","innovator","need","problem","symptom","usage"].
RELATION has to be one of  ["has developed","has development stage","fullfills","solves","case disruption","has benefit","has improvement", "embodied by", "has usage", "manifested by", "has symptom"]

The RELATIONSHIP signifies the relationship between these entities.
The relationships are defined between two classes of entities, Class I (the subject) and Class II (the object). The relationship or predicate describes the connection between these two entities. Relation should be one of the following.
Class I (Subject) -> Relation (Predicate) -> Class II (Object)
innovator -> has developed -> innovation
innovation -> has development stage -> development stage
innovation -> fullfills -> need
innovation -> solves -> problem
problem -> has symptom -> symptom
innovation -> case disruption -> disruption
innovation -> has benefit -> benefits
innovation -> has improvement -> improvement
innovation -> embodied by -> embodiment
embodiment -> has usage -> usage
need -> manifested by -> problem

Sentence:  Blockchain technology, embodied by cryptocurrency, causes disruption in the banking sector and is used for digital transactions.
Triplet: [{"head": "Blockchain technology", "relation": "causes disruption", "tail": "banking sector"},
{"head": "Cryptocurrency", "relation": "embodied by", "tail": "Blockchain technology"},
{"head": "Cryptocurrency", "relation": "has usage", "tail": "digital transactions"}]
