Class I (Subject) -> Relation (Predicate) -> Class II (Object)
system -> has part directly -> component
hardware component -> has part directly -> hardware part
component -> implements -> function
hardware component -> implements -> function
hardware part -> implements -> function
hardware subpart -> implements -> function
software -> implements -> function
system -> implements -> function
processing unit -> executes -> software
hardware subpart -> part of directly -> hardware part
component -> has Property -> quantity
hardware component -> has Property -> quantity
hardware part -> has Property -> quantity
hardware subpart -> has Property -> quantity
software -> has Property -> quantity
system -> has Property -> quantity
processing unit -> executes -> software
quantity -> has value -> measure
