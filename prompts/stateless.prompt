Given a prompt, extrapolate as many relationships as possible from it and provide a list of updates.

If an update is a relationship, provide [ENTITY 1, RELATIONSHIP, ENTITY 2]. The relationship is directed, so the order matters. 
ENTITY must not contain more than 3 words/token. 
ENTITY has to be subclass of ["component","function","hardware component","hardware part","hardware subpart","measure","quantity","software","system","unit"].

prompt: Alice is Bob's roommate.
updates:

prompt: $prompt
