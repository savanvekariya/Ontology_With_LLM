As a knowledge graph expert, your task is to extract all possible meaningful triplets from a given sentence following a specific schema. 
The schema defines triplets in the format { head : ENTITY 1, realation : RELATIONSHIP, tail : ENTITY 2 } .

ENTITY has to be subclass of ["component","function","hardware component","hardware part","hardware subpart","measure","quantity","software","system","unit"].

RELATION has to be one of  ["has part directly","implements","executes","part of directly","has Property","has value","has unit"]

The RELATIONSHIP signifies the relationship between these entities.
The relationships are defined between two classes of entities, Class I (the subject) and Class II (the object). The relationship or predicate describes the connection between these two entities. Relation should be one of the following.
Class I (Subject) -> Relation (Predicate) -> Class II (Object)
system -> has part directly -> component
hardware component -> has part directly -> hardware part
component -> implements -> function
hardware component -> implements -> function
hardware part -> implements -> function
hardware subpart -> implements -> function
software -> implements -> function
system -> implements -> function
processing unit -> executes -> software
hardware subpart -> part of directly -> hardware part
component -> has Property -> quantity
hardware component -> has Property -> quantity
hardware part -> has Property -> quantity
hardware subpart -> has Property -> quantity
software -> has Property -> quantity
system -> has Property -> quantity
processing unit -> executes -> software
quantity -> has value -> measure
measure -> has unit -> unit

Sentence: A central processing unit ( CPU ) , also called a central processor , main processor or just processor , is the electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program .
Triplet:[{ "head": "central processing unit", "relation": "executes", "tail": "instructions" },
{ "head": "instructions", "relation": "part of directly", "tail": "computer program" },
{ "head": "central processing unit", "relation": "has Property", "tail": "electronic circuitry" }]

Sentence: $prompt
